## üé® Features

- **Interactive Color Quantization**: Reduce images to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 colors
- **Real-time Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of original and quantized images
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive analysis including MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and compression ratios
- **Color Palette Analysis**: Detailed color palette visualization with pixel count histograms
- **Export Options**: Download quantized images, color palettes, and detailed reports
- **Undo/Redo**: Session history management for workflow flexibility
- **Color Similarity Highlighting**: Advanced color analysis with similarity detection

**Note**: End users can access the application directly at [https://mediancut.streamlit.app/](https://mediancut.streamlit.app/) without installing anything.

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the file uploader to select a JPG, JPEG, or PNG image
2. **View Comparison**: The app automatically generates quantized versions with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 colors
3. **Analyze Results**: Review quality metrics and color palette information
4. **Export**: Download your preferred quantized image and analysis reports

### Advanced Features

#### Color Palette Analysis
- **Color Swatches**: Visual representation of the generated color palette
- **Histogram**: Pixel count distribution across colors
- **Color Highlighting**: Identify similar colors using various similarity metrics

#### Quality Metrics
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures pixel-wise difference between original and quantized
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Logarithmic measure of image quality
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Perceptual quality assessment
- **Compression Ratio**: File size reduction achieved

#### Export Options
- **Quantized Image**: Download the processed image
- **Color Palette**: Export palette as image or CSS
- **Text Report**: Detailed metrics and analysis
- **HTML Report**: Complete report with embedded comparison images
- **Comparison Image**: Side-by-side visualization

## üîß Technical Details

### Median-Cut Algorithm

The median-cut algorithm works by:

1. **Color Space Analysis**: Converting the image to RGB color space
2. **Range Calculation**: Finding the color channel with the largest range
3. **Recursive Splitting**: Dividing the color space into smaller boxes
4. **Color Averaging**: Computing representative colors for each box
5. **Nearest Neighbor Mapping**: Mapping original pixels to the closest palette color

### Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k) where n is the number of pixels and k is the number of colors
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing pixel data
- **Quality**: Provides good balance between compression and visual quality

## üìä Performance Metrics

The application calculates several quality metrics:

- **MSE**: Lower values indicate better quality
- **PSNR**: Higher values indicate better quality (typically 20-40 dB for good results)
- **SSIM**: Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 being identical
- **Compression Ratio**: Shows the reduction in color information

## üé® Use Cases

- **Web Design**: Create color palettes for websites and applications
- **Image Compression**: Reduce file sizes while maintaining quality
- **Artistic Effects**: Create stylized or retro image effects
- **Data Visualization**: Generate consistent color schemes
- **Print Design**: Optimize images for limited color printing

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Image Upload Problems**
   - Ensure the image is in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format
   - Check file size (recommended < 10MB for optimal performance)

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Large images may take longer to process
   - Consider resizing very large images before upload

3. **Export Issues**
   - Ensure sufficient disk space for downloads
   - Check browser download settings

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
